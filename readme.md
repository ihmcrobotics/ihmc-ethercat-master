# IHMC EtherCAT Master

This package provides a lightweight java wrapper around SOEM (https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM) and provides an Object Orientated interface to the EtherCAT master.

Extra functionality built on top of SOEM includes 

- Automatic configuration of PDO's
- EtherCAT slave state management
- Thread synchronization with DC Master Clock


## Usage

### Supported operating systems

The IHMC EtherCAT master has a native component that is currently compiled for Linux only.

- Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and Ubuntu 18.04
- Requires OpenJDK JRE 8 or higher (Compatible JRE's should work).
- Native library is compiled statically on Ubuntu 16.04, should work on most distributions


### Gradle

Add the IHMC EtherCAT Master as dependency
```
repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}
	
dependencies {
	implementation group: 'us.ihmc', name: 'ihmc-ethercat-master', version: '0.14.0'
}
```

### Examples

Example code is provided in us.ihmc.etherCAT.examples. 


## Supported slaves

All conforming EtherCAT slaves should work with this wrapper. Slave code has been provided for several devices, including

- Beckhoff EK1100
- Beckhoff EL3314
- Beckhoff EL4134
- Elmo Twitter 

General slave code provided 
- DSP402 statemachine

Custom slave code is straightforward to implement based on provided slave examples.


## Slave information
To show the slaves available on the bus the provided class us.ihmc.etherCAT.master.SlaveInfo can be used.

## Compiling

This library is split up in two parts, the C library with SWIG wrapper and the actual Java library. They need to be compiled independently. SOEM needs to be compiled with position independent code enabled, otherwise a shared JNI library cannot be build.

### Installing SOEM

The Halodi Robotics PPA has a debian package of SOEM that is compatible with this library. Install it using

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:halodirobotics/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install soem
```

#### (Optional, not recommended) Compiling SOEM

~Clone SOEM from https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM~
- ~git clone https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM.git~

~Optionally, use switch to the same version as used to compile the maven libraries~
- ~cd SOEM~
- ~git checkout v1.4.0~

Note that in order to build a shared JNI library, you have to enable position independent code for SOEM. Use the following commands to build and install the SOEM library

```
cd SOEM
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DHOST_INSTALL="" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make install
```

### Compiling C library and SWIG wrapper

#### Requirements
- CMake
- OpenJDK 8
- Swig 3.0.8 or higher.

A gradle wrapper is provided, optionally you can use your system gradle by replacing "./gradlew" with gradle.


The gradle build files for the SOEM wrapper and native libraries are created by cmake, based on the input files in swig/build.gradle.kts.in and swig/settings.gradle.kts.in. After running cmake and make, the gradle build is exectud from the build directory. This is done to split the GPL+linking exception licenced SOEM from the Apache 2.0 licensed IHMC-ethercat-master. 


To build and publish run the following commands. Note that the gradle commands are ran from within the build directory.


- cd ihmc-ethercat-master
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
- make
- ../gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Ptarget=JAVA
- ../gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Ptarget=PLATFORM

Note that if you want to publish multiple platform libraries you only have to run target=JAVA on a single platform


### Compiling Java library
- cd ihmc-ethercat-master
- ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

### Compiling with Docker

Run `./buildWithDocker.sh`

The Docker image is hosted at [https://hub.docker.com/r/ihmcrobotics/ethercat-master]().

If changes to the Dockerfile are needed, build it with the following command, incrementing the version.
Then, increment the version in the buildWithDocker.sh file before running.

```
# docker build --tag ihmcrobotics/ethercat-master:0.X .
# docker rm ethercat-master
```
